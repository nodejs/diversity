# Contributing to the Node.js Diversity Working Group

## How the Diversity Working Group operates

The Diversity Working Group is committed to fostering a safe, inclusive environment for people to contribute. Given the sensitive nature of the discussions in the Diversity Working Group, a private, confidential communication mechanism is a necessity.

We greatly value working in an open manner, and all of the operations of the Diversity Working Group would be done in public in an ideal world. Sadly we do not live in an ideal world, and harassment and retaliation are real threats.

Radical transparency can be dangerous to underrepresented people because "it may provide additional information that abusers can use to target them. In addition, even routine practices of theirs might be unduly criticized when revealed by radical transparency (eg, their practice of earning a living)." (source: [Geek Feminism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Radical_transparency)).

Given that the Diversity Working Group is, by definition, working with sensitive topics, it is ultimately in participant's best interest for most communications to be private.

The Diversity Working Group uses [Slack](node-diversity-wg.slack.com), a private invite only chat system, for most communication. Meetings are held using Google Hangout links that are distributed in the Slack channel, and are also private meetings.

Meetings, meeting notes, etc are also kept private. An anonymized summary of meeting notes are posted publicly to GitHub for people to track the progress of the Diversity Working Group.

## Code of Conduct

### Purpose

The core of the Node.js community is the people in it. Our primary goal is ensure this community is as inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other marginalized aspect of attendees.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the Node.js Diversity Working Group to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### Node.js Diversity Working Group Community Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase community citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### Expected Behavior

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Don't make assumptions about a person's background, abilities, or intentions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an official working group member if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech, actions, or microaggressions by any participant in our community on GitHub, related chat services, or other online spaces, in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of working group business, in person events, or at community related social events (such as a bar after an official event). Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial or sexual slights and insults. We consider microaggressions to be a form of harassment, and we will take appropriate action for incidences of microagressions.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, official working group members may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event). Individuals who have been banned will be prohibited from participating in GitHub discussions, issues, pull requests, any webcasts or other online or offline Node.js Diversity Working Group events.

### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a working group member as soon as possible. Full contact information is listed in the Contact Info section of this document. All communications will be kept strictly confidential, unless otherwise required by law. No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant.

Additionally, official working group members are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

### Governing Policy and Addressing Grievances

If you receive a temporary or permanent ban, you will be [blocked on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-a-user/) for the Diversity repository and prohibited from participating in any webcasts or other online or offline Node.js Diversity Working Group events. If you receive a temporary ban, you will be notified via the email address listed on your GitHub profile, if listed, once the ban has been lifted and you are allowed to rejoin the community.

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify us with a concise description of your grievance at the email address listed under Contact Info. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our governing policies.
