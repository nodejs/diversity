# Inclusivity Working Group

## Proposed Charter

(This charter has not yet been ratified by the Node.js TSC.)

### Statement of Purpose

The Inclusivity Working Group seeks to increase inclusivity and diversity
for the Node.js project:
  - Increasing inclusivity seeks to make the Node.js project a safe and
    friendly place for people from diverse backgrounds.
  - Increasing diversity seeks to actively onboard people from diverse
    backgrounds to the Node.js project and maintain their participation. 

### Code of Conduct

Due to the nature of the work the Inclusivity Working Group engages in,
it employs a more specific and stricter Code of Conduct than the Node.js
project. It is our belief that both Codes of Conduct are in the same spirit,
the Working Groups' CoC simply being an extension of the Node CoC, with 
additional operations details re: enforcement.

### Scope

The Inclusivity Working Group shall have autonomy over enforcing it's own
Code of Conduct and moderating its own PRs, issues, Slacks, and other
community spaces.

The Inclusivity Working Group explicitly does *not* have moderation or
enforcement power in the greater Node community or Project. It will,
however, make recommendations and provide guidance to the community
of collaborators on moderation and enforcement in
regards to incidents on the project and in the community. These
recommendations are not binding in any way.

If those recommendations are controversial or cannot be resolved through
normal discourse, then they can be escalated to the TSC per the normal
governance process.

### List of Responsibilities

* Foster a welcoming environment that ensures participants are valued and can
feel confident contributing or joining discussions regardless of any aspect of 
their identity, including but not limited to:
  - racial or ethnic background
  - nationality
  - language
  - skill level or expertise
  - [gender or sex][1]
  - physical or mental ability
  - age
  - religion, or lack thereof
* Proactively seek and propose concrete steps the project can take to increase
inclusivity.
* Serve as a resource for the development and enforcement of workflows that 
protect community members and projects from harassment and abuse.
* Acknowledge and celebrate existing diversity accomplishments within the
project while seeking to build upon them.
* Identify ways to measure diversity and inclusivity within the project and
report them at regular intervals

### Communication Policy

As is the case in the TSC, the Inclusivity Working Group seeks to be as 
transparent and public in its communications as possible.

However, due to the nature of the work the WG engages in, it is necessary
that some private and invite-only spaces exist.

Private spaces will specifically be created to discuss:
- Incident Reporting
- Incident Response
- Early Policy Discussions

All private communication will be anonymized and posted publicly for discussion.
In no way will any binding decisions be made in private. All decisions will be 
either line items in public reports or, for larger topics, be summarized in public
issues, specifically to receive structured community feedback for no less than a
one week review period.

We believe that private spaces will mitigate the intense, often unintended public
backlash people can often incur when dealing with an inclusivity situation. The
goal for the private spaces is to create a safe space for education and understanding.
