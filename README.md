# Inclusivity Working Group

This working group is still in the early stages of getting up and running. Check back soon for more info!

If you are interested in helping shape this WG, have a look at the issues and PRs. A good starting point is usually the charter proposal ([#21](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/pull/21)). Just jump in and introduce yourself!
